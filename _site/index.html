        <h1 class="post-title">2nd Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Resilience (CPS-SR)</h1>

<h2 id="workshop-scope">Workshop Scope</h2>
<p>Cyber-physical systems underpin many of the critical infrastructures that our society depends on. As a consequence, they have very high reliability and availability requirements. Recently, there have been a number of high-profile cyber-attacks to critical infrastructures, which include cyber-physical systems, that have resulted in major disruptions in the physical domain. These threats include a sophisticated cyber-attack component, whose aim is to manipulate the control behavior of a target system.</p>

<p>To address these threats, a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary that draws on and integrates research findings from cyber security, resilient control, formal methods, human factors, and applied knowledge of the cyber-physical system under attack, for example. The aim of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers in disciplines that are related to ensuring the security and resilience of cyber-physical systems, to discuss hot topics and research directions that will lead to (reusable) solutions that are applicable to numerous forms of cyber-physical system.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-format">Workshop Format</h2>
<p>The workshop programme will consist of invited presentations on hot topics in cyber-physical systems security and resilience. In addition, peer-reviewed papers will be presented and discussed. The aim is to provide opportunities for discussion and community building.</p>
