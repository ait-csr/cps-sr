# Workshop Scope
Cyber-physical systems underpin many of the critical infrastructures that our society depends on. As a consequence, they have very high reliability and availability requirements. Recently, there have been a number of high-profile cyber-attacks to critical infrastructures, which include cyber-physical systems, that have resulted in major disruptions in the physical domain. These threats include a sophisticated cyber-attack component, whose aim is to manipulate the control behaviour of a target system.

To address these threats, a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary that draws on and integrates research findings from cyber security, resilient control, formal methods, human factors, and applied knowledge of the cyber-physical system under attack, for example. The aim of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers in disciplines that are related to ensuring the *security* and *resilience* of cyber-physical systems, to discuss hot topics and research directions that will lead to (reusable) solutions that are applicable to numerous forms of cyber-physical system.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of CPS security and resilience:

* Security and resilience measurement
* Resilient control
* Hyperproperties in CPS
* Cyber-physical intrusion detection
* New forms of attack to CPS
* Human performance
* Secure and resilient CPS architectures
* Applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence
* Digital twins and security

# Paper Submissions
Papers are encouraged that present early research or position statements, which preferably include initial results, or mature (previously published) findings that could benefit from being discussed in a workshop setting. Submitted papers, written in English, should not exceed four pages in length. Please follow the [ACM conference format guidelines](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and submit your work via the [HotCRP submission system](https://cps-sr19.hotcrp.com/). Please note the papers will not be published in a proceedings but will be made available via this website.

# Important Dates
